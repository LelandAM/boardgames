Created as a group "client" project for DBC Chicago by Mark Cassidy, Kyri Kalpakidis, Leland Meiners, and Benji Shyman. 

Our goal was to build a board game database where users could build a secure profile and add favorite boardgames to it as well as request and accept friends. They can also navigate through our database of boardgames with the ability to rate or comment on each game, and rate comments. 

Created with Ruby on Rails, Materialize SASS, JQuery, SQLite, and the Board Game Geek API. Tested with Travis. 

To view clone down a branch, create, migrate and seed the database, then start a local server.
